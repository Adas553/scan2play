# Session Handoff — 2026-09-29

Where the work stands, for whoever continues (a new Claude Code session or a person). The history of the
first session (2026-09-28, remote) is summarised at the bottom.

## Where things stand

- Branch `dev`: `origin/dev` = `0519d78` (the 8 commits below plus one docs commit that added `CLAUDE.md` and this
  file). **Phase 2, stages 4 and 5 are committed on top of it as two local commits and NOT pushed yet** — first the
  client code (`youtube-autopilot.js` rewritten, `dashboard.js`, `dashboard.html`), then the docs (`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
  with Section 5.4 rewritten and Sections 5.1/13/14 updated, `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, this
  file, and three stale comments in `DjPartySettingsController` / `DjDashboardController` — comments only).
  `git status -sb` shows whether they have gone out. `main` is untouched (`5314006`).
- One stash, deliberately parked: *"Spotify playback redirect-uri as {baseUrl} template (parked: Spotify rejects
  http://localhost)"*. It makes `spotify.oauth.redirect-uri` follow the request host like the login flow does.
  Spotify only accepts HTTPS or a loopback IP (`127.0.0.1`) redirect URI, so it does not help local testing
  until the app is opened via `127.0.0.1`/HTTPS. `git stash pop` restores it.
- Tests: 146 tests pass (`.\mvnw.cmd -B test "-Dtest=!Scan2playApplicationTests"`, see `CLAUDE.md` for how to
  run them without disturbing the app running from IntelliJ) — re-run on 2026-09-29 in a scratch copy of the working
  tree after stages 4 and 5 (`BUILD SUCCESS`; the Java changes are comments only). Nothing in `youtube-autopilot.js`
  has automated tests; stage 4 was verified against the real YouTube player instead (see below).

## What was done (commit order)

| Commit | What |
|--------|------|
| `18f8281` | `@Builder.Default` on `PartySettingsEntity` — new parties were created with limits 0/0/0 |
| `1afdecf` | Auto-Pilot no longer jumps to a queued guest song when the DJ seeks the background track (`fallbackTrackChanged`) |
| `3da8ece` | Unit tests for `findNextPlayableGuestTrack` and `GET /dj/dashboard/next-guest-track` |
| `3670e57` | `SCAN2PLAY_GUEST_URL` documented (QR code / party link; use the LAN IP for a phone) |
| `2c0a19b` | **Flyway** adopted, baseline `V1` (Section 10 of `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`) |
| `acc9201` | **Phase 2, stage 2**: `V2__create_fallback_track`, `YouTubePlaylistClient`, `FallbackPlaylistService` — the playlist is imported into the DB when the DJ sets it |
| `046f243` | `V3`: parties with `request_limit`/`cooldown_minutes` < 1 get 2 / 3 (zero disabled guest rate limiting) |
| `c0d1e2b` | **Phase 2, stage 3**: `POST /dj/dashboard/next-track` (`NextTrackService`) — guest first, else the next background track |
| after `0519d78` | **Phase 2, stage 4**: `youtube-autopilot.js` becomes a "dumb player" that asks `next-track` (see below) |
| after that | Docs (stage 5): Section 5.4 rewritten, Section 14 marks Phase 1–2 done, three stale comments fixed, this file |

The Section 14 stage table in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` is the authoritative progress list.

## Phase 2, stage 4 — the client uses the server (done)

`youtube-autopilot.js` is now the "dumb player" of the roadmap. It asks `POST /dj/dashboard/next-track` **only when a
track is about to be loaded**: Auto-Pilot on and the player idle (page load, Auto-Pilot switched on, the dashboard's
3 s poll), on `ENDED`, and after a player error. The endpoint is **not read-only** (it marks a background track
`PLAYED` as it hands it out), so it is never polled. Decisions taken with the owner on 2026-09-29:

- A guest song that arrives while a background track **plays** waits until it ends (same as the old playlist boundary).
- A **paused** player is never touched — a pause is the DJ's choice (the old code switched a paused *fallback* track to
  a waiting guest immediately). With Auto-Pilot **off** nothing starts by itself when a track ends.
- The dashboard does not show the import result (`X-Fallback-Import: ok|failed`) yet — left for a separate step.

Side effect to be aware of: a track the DJ starts by hand (▶ link) is no longer overridden by Auto-Pilot within 3 s (the
old "orphaned playback" branch paused it and started the next song); when it ends, Auto-Pilot carries on.

Removed from the JS: `loadPlaylist`/`setShuffle`/`setLoop`, the playlist index/video tracking (`fallbackTrackChanged`,
`fallbackTrackIndex`, `lastFallbackIndex`, `fallbackVideoId`), `guestSongPending`, `pendingPlaylistSetup`, the BUFFERING
early detection, `stateVersion`, `updateFallbackShuffle`, the `data-fallback-*` attributes on `#yt-player-card`. Kept:
`erroredSongIds` (sent as `exclude`), `lastMarkedPlayedId`, guest confirmation via `POST /dj/dashboard/play`.
`window.updateFallbackSource` / `stopFallback` remain, now meaning "drop the running *background* track" (a playing guest
song is left alone). `GET /dj/dashboard/next-guest-track` is no longer called by the client (endpoint and tests kept).

Details worth knowing:
- After 5 player errors in a row (no video reached `PLAYING`) the client stops asking immediately and leaves it to the poll
  (one ask per 3 s), so a playlist of unplayable videos is not burnt through in a tight loop.
- The answer of a lookup is dropped if, meanwhile, Auto-Pilot was switched off or the DJ started a track by hand. A
  background track handed out for a dropped answer is skipped for that round of the playlist (acceptable); a guest song
  is not consumed until it plays.
- `stopFallbackPlaylist()` in `dashboard.js` now stops the player only **after** the server has cleared the playlist —
  stopping first would let the poll ask for a new track in between.
- Measured on the real player (server stubbed at 0 ms): `ENDED` → next track `PLAYING` = 230–250 ms, which is YouTube's
  own load time. **No pre-fetching needed** unless a gap turns out to be audible at a real party.

**How it was verified (no login needed):** a throw-away static page with the real `youtube-autopilot.js`, `window.fetch`
stubbed for `/dj/dashboard/*`, `YT.Player` wrapped to log every `onStateChange` with `getVideoData().video_id`, served by
`python -m http.server` and opened in the built-in browser (the page is not kept in the repo). 13 scenarios passed: start
when idle (1 request, no `/play`); polls while playing and while paused (0 requests); `ENDED` → waiting guest plays and is
confirmed exactly once; a guest song the player cannot play (→ `exclude=<id>`, not confirmed); a run of errors (6 requests,
then one per poll); Auto-Pilot off (nothing on `ENDED`, resumes when switched on); `updateFallbackSource` stops a
background track but not a guest song; a hand-picked track is not overridden and Auto-Pilot continues after it; three
simultaneous triggers = 1 request; the answer is dropped when Auto-Pilot is switched off or a track is picked by hand
during the lookup.
Gotchas of that setup: the page needs a real click first (user activation) or YouTube leaves the player on the play button,
and the browser tab must be visible; `YT.Player` methods exist only after `onReady` (wrap them there); the player pauses
itself after a few seconds unless muted (`__p.mute()`); many well-known videos have embedding disabled and fail with error
150 (`jNQXAC9IZ_w`, `dQw4w9WgXcQ`, `9bZkp7q19f0`) — `M7lc1UVf-VE` and `aqz-KE-bpKQ` play fine.

## Next

1. Done on 2026-09-29: the owner tried the new client by hand on the real dashboard and reported that it works well.
   If it ever needs repeating: restart the app (Flyway applies pending migrations), hard-refresh the dashboard
   (Ctrl+F5 — the JS is cached) and, with Auto-Pilot on and a fallback playlist set, check that saving the playlist
   starts a track by itself; the next track follows when one ends; a guest song added meanwhile plays after the current
   track and shows up as played; pausing changes nothing; with Auto-Pilot off the music stops after the track; the
   ⏹ Stop button stops it and it does not restart; the shuffle switch takes effect from the next track.
2. Push `dev` when the owner says so (the two commits above are local only).
3. Phase 2 is complete. What remains is optional (listed at the end of Phase 2 in Section 14):
   show the import result on the dashboard (`X-Fallback-Import: ok|failed`, `X-Fallback-Import-Reason`) instead of
   always flashing the Save button green; remove `GET /dj/dashboard/next-guest-track` and its tests, which nothing calls
   any more; browser-level tests for `youtube-autopilot.js`.
4. `dev` → `main` is the next real decision (open items 1 and 4 below), but the owner said on 2026-09-29 that they do
   **not** want to merge yet — leave `main` alone until they bring it up.

## Open items for the owner

1. **`main`** is still the old pre-session state. Merging `dev` into `main` is a deliberate step (see `AGENTS.md`): the
   production database has never been checked against `V1` (item 4) and the client still has no browser-level tests.
2. **`YOUTUBE_API_KEY`**: the production key was pasted into a chat/screenshot on 2026-09-28 — rotate or restrict it
   (Google Cloud Console → Credentials: restrict to the YouTube Data API v3). Local run configuration: the variable
   name must have no stray characters (it had a trailing `:`, which silently disabled the key).
3. **Restart the app locally** so Flyway applies `V3` to the local `scan2play` database (`V1`/`V2` are applied) — see
   "Next" item 1, the same restart also loads the stage 4 client.
4. **First production deploy** of Flyway: backup, compare `pg_dump --schema-only` with `V1__baseline.sql`
   (checklist in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, Section 10). The production schema has never been checked against `V1`.
5. Spotify locally: see the stash above; the Spotify Developer Dashboard also needs the redirect URIs.

## History — first session (2026-09-28, remote Claude Code)

That session attached the repo, committed the three previously local-only docs (`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) to `dev`, fixed a stale Section 5.4, wrote the "Master Queue" roadmap (Section 14),
found that its `PENDING`/`APPROVED` guest-approval gate never existed in the code, shipped Phase 1 (server-side
`next-guest-track`, `e811ba4`) and replaced the hardcoded production OAuth2 login redirect URIs with
`{baseUrl}` templates. Its Phase 1 change had not been build-verified; that was done in the second session.
